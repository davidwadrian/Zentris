Zentris is a simple Tetris clone written in jQuery using DOM elements to represent the tiles and play area.

What works: Falling pieces, rotating pieces, placing pieces, and clearing lines.

What doesn't work: True-to-tetris scoring, true-to-tetris speed up of falling blocks, levels, wall kicks (if you're into that in your Tetris)

To play: Open up index.html and click the message that appears. Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the falling blocks.
